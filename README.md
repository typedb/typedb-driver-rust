## Project Status
This is a **work in progress** and is not yet suitable for production usage.

It can connect to TypeDB, run read and write queries, and return answers. Concept API methods are not available yet.

## Client Architecture
To learn about the mechanism that a TypeDB Client uses to set up communication with databases running on the TypeDB Server, refer to [TypeDB > Client API > Overview](http://docs.vaticle.com/docs/client-api/overview).

The TypeDB Client for Rust provides a fully async API that supports the [`tokio`](https://crates.io/crates/tokio) **multi-threaded** runtime.

## Quickstart
1. Import `typedb-client` through Cargo:
```toml
typedb-client = "0.1.1"
```
2. Make sure the [TypeDB Server](https://docs.vaticle.com/docs/running-typedb/install-and-run#start-the-typedb-server) is running.
3. Import `typedb_client::TypeDBClient`, instantiate a TypeDB Core client, open a session to a [database](https://docs.vaticle.com/docs/management/database), and run basic insertion and retrieval queries:
```rust
use typedb_client::concept::{Concept, Thing};
use typedb_client::session::Type::Data;
use typedb_client::transaction::Type::{Read, Write};
use typedb_client::TypeDBClient;
```
```rust
let mut client = TypeDBClient::new("http://0.0.0.0:1729").await?;
let session = client.session("social_network", Data).await?;
{
    // Transactions (and sessions) get closed on drop, or can be manually closed by calling close()
    let mut tx = session.transaction(Write).await?;
    tx.query.insert("insert $x isa person, has email \"x@email.com\";");
    // To persist changes, a write transaction must always be committed. This also closes the transaction.
    tx.commit().await?;
}
{
    let mut tx = session.transaction(Read).await?;
    let mut answer_stream = tx.query.match_("match $p isa person, has email $e; limit 10;");
    while let Some(result) = answer_stream.next().await {
        match result {
            Ok(answer) => {
                match answer.get("e") {
                    // The Concept type hierarchy is represented by the Concept enum
                    Concept::Thing(Thing::Attribute(Attribute::String(value))) => { println!("email: {}", value); }
                    _ => { panic!(); }
                }
            }
            Err(err) => panic!("An error occurred fetching answers of a Match query: {}", err)
        }
    }
}
```

## Examples
More code examples can be found in `tests/queries.rs`.

## Build from Source
> Note: You don't need to compile TypeDB Client from source if you just want to use it in your code. See the _"Quickstart"_ section above.

1. Make sure you have [Bazel](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install.html) installed on your machine.

2. Build the library:

   a) to build the native/raw rlib:
   ```
   bazel build //:typedb_client
   ```
   The rlib will be produced at: `bazel-bin/libtypedb_client-{hash}.rlib`.

   b) to build the crate for a Cargo project:
   ```
   bazel build //:assemble_crate
   ```
   The Cargo crate will be produced at:
   ```
   bazel-bin/assemble_crate.crate
   ```
   You can then unzip this crate to retrieve `Cargo.toml`. **Please note**: this process has not yet been thoroughly tested. The generated `Cargo.toml` may not be fully correct. See the `Cargo.toml` of the `typedb-client` crate for reference.
